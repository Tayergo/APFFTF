# Setup this program!
git clone https://github.com/XeonBionic/APFFTF
Then, edit the python file to specify the path that the .sh files are in.
You also wanna set the 'btt2.sh' file to chmod +x, and 'update.sh' to chmod +777.
On my computer, it's /home/xeon/sysfunction. 
then, in the folder where the python and shell files are, run 'python3 ./bttfrntend.py'
note: the update.sh file uses yay, and therefore needs yay to be installed for it to work. you can modify this to work with your setup/distro.
